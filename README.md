# Smart Security System
![Security System](security-banner.png)

## 🔒 Overview
A smart security system that integrates AI-powered anomaly detection with real-time response mechanisms. The system processes feeds from IP cameras, manages access control, and provides immediate response to security threats through a priority-based event handling system.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**
  - Real-time video analysis
  - Behavior pattern recognition
  - Multiple sensor integration

- **Priority-Based Event Handling**
  - Critical event immediate response
  - Automated security protocols
  - Queue-based event processing

- **Intelligent Surveillance**
  - Adaptive camera control
  - PTZ automation
  - High-definition recording on demand

- **Access Control**
  - Zone-based lockdown
  - Emergency protocols
  - Multi-level authentication

- **Real-time Notifications**
  - Mobile alerts via Firebase
  - Priority-based messaging
  - Multi-channel communication

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 6.0
- **AI/ML**: Deep Learning models
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Database**: SQL Server

## 📋 Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK
- SQL Server
- Firebase account
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash

```

## 🚦 Usage

```csharp
// Initialize the security system
var securitySystem = new SecuritySystem(configuration);

// Handle anomaly detection
await securitySystem.ProcessEvent(new AnomalyEvent 
{
    Priority = AnomalyPriority.Critical,
    CameraId = "CAM001",
    AnomalyType = "Unauthorized Access"
});
```
